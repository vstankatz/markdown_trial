# The Greatest, _and only_, Blog on Mars

When we crash landed here **eight** years ago I don't think any of us thought we'd survive, but with the help of our [martian friends](https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2015/05/bushman.jpg?resize=865,452) we survived the blazing winter of Mars and actually flourished!
Check out the pictures of our martian vegetable garden:

Don't know how much longer we'll continue to be treated as friends and not food or forced \*labor\*, like **all** the children we bought...
